latest working branch: userPass
    ViewController (favorite groups) and GroupTableVC (favObjects in a group) actually shows what's stored in the user's account
    
current problem: 
    put buttons in collectionViewCells but when the collectionView doesnâ€™t recognize pressing buttons as selecting the cells. So no paths are selected
